# Excursion
Excursion is an off-platform project from the Learn GitHub course by Codecademy (https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-git/projects/f1-excursion)

1. I needed to set up my project in Git
2. Then I connected it to a repository in GitHub
3. I followed the instructions on the codecademy site to recreate a landing page from the exercise
4. I used vs code to create the content of the HTML and CSS files
5. I pushed my commits to the remote repository
